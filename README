C wrapper library and python module (using ctypes and numpy) to
control the HPTDC8-PCI card from Cronologic.

The C wrapper library, hptdc_wrapper.dll, is included, but if you want
to build it yourself, the Makefile is also included.  It should build
fine with Visual Studio Express 2010 and nmake.

Available classes are TDCManager and TDCHit. All methods of TDCManager
are available, but in underscore_case (since CamelCase is
evil). E.g. instead of ReadTDCHit, you call read_tdc_hit. The method
Continue is called continu because python disallows a method with that
name.
